[Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) is a self‑hosted monitoring tool designed to track service uptime, website availability, performance, ports, APIs, cronjobs, and much more. It provides a clean, modern interface and a powerful set of monitoring features suitable for both small setups and complex infrastructures.

The project aims to be an open‑source, privacy‑respecting alternative to third‑party uptime monitoring services. With support for customizable alerts, status pages, multiple notification channels, and flexible deployment options, Uptime Kuma empowers users to maintain full control over their monitoring stack without relying on external SaaS platforms.
