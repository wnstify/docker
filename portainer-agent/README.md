The **Portainer Agent** is a lightweight application designed to facilitate secure communication between the Portainer server and remote Docker environments. It enables Portainer to manage containerized applications across multiple hosts, regardless of whether they are running on standalone Docker instances, Docker Swarm clusters, or Kubernetes environments.

## Features

- **Remote Management**: Allows the Portainer server to manage remote Docker or Kubernetes environments securely.
- **Multi-Environment Support**:
  - Works seamlessly with Docker standalone, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes clusters.
- **Secure Communication**:
  - Uses secure WebSocket connections for data transfer between the Portainer server and the agent.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**:
  - Lightweight and optimized to minimize resource consumption on the host system.
- **Automatic Discovery**:
  - Automatically detects containers, networks, and volumes in the connected environment.
- **Firewall-Friendly**:
  - Operates over a single configurable port, simplifying deployment in restricted network environments.

## Why Use Portainer Agent?

- **Simplified Remote Access**: Eliminates the need for direct network access to remote environments.
- **Centralized Management**: Enables Portainer to manage multiple environments from a single control plane.
- **Ease of Deployment**: Can be deployed as a Docker container or Kubernetes pod, making it simple to set up.

## How It Works

1. **Communication Bridge**:
   - The agent acts as a communication bridge between the Portainer server and the target Docker or Kubernetes environment.
   - Secure WebSocket connections ensure reliable and encrypted communication.

2. **Environment Integration**:
   - For Docker, the agent interacts directly with the Docker API to retrieve information about containers, images, networks, and volumes.
   - For Kubernetes, the agent interacts with the Kubernetes API to provide access to namespaces, workloads, and other resources.

## Supported Environments

- **Docker Standalone**: Manage containers on a single Docker instance.
- **Docker Swarm**: Manage services and nodes in a Swarm cluster.
- **Kubernetes**: Manage pods, namespaces, and workloads in Kubernetes clusters.
